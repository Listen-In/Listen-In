      "body": "James Brown's catalogue is full of gems, some more widely known than others. This song should be known to longtime James Brown fans, but more casual listeners may not have heard this under hits like 'I Feel Good' or 'Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.' This song includes everything you'd want in a James Brown classic: a tight drum backbeat, a fat bassline, James Brown's rich vocals, and an outro that features him directing his band. "
